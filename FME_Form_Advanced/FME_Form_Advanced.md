# FME Form Advanced – End-to-End Project-Based Learning Journey

Welcome to my hands-on journey through the [FME Form Advanced](https://academy.safe.com/path/fme-form-advanced) training by Safe Software. This course builds on core FME skills and introduces advanced techniques like workspace parameterization, schema evolution, modular design, and dynamic data handling. 

This repository contains structured, real-world-inspired **mini-projects** developed from course modules to demonstrate my practical expertise with FME Form at an intermediate to advanced level.

---

## Learning Goals

- Build modular, maintainable FME workspaces
- Automate workflows using parameters and fanouts
- Design for schema flexibility and data variability
- Optimize performance and handle schema changes dynamically

---

## Course Overview

| Course | Level | Modules | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| [FME Form Advanced](https://academy.safe.com/path/fme-form-advanced) | Intermediate–Advanced | 15 Modules | In Progress (July–Aug 2025) |

This folder is a live collection of exercise-based mini-projects that demonstrate my ability to apply advanced FME concepts in spatial and non-spatial data automation workflows.

---
## Project Structure

The course is divided into two parts. Each day contains focused exercises which I've converted into sub-projects, organized into folders with workflows, explanations, and screenshots.

```
---

### Topics Covered in Part 2
- Using the generic mode for flexible format handling
- Schema mapping from incoming or external data
- Automating schema construction with `SchemaScanner`
- Designing format-agnostic workspaces

---

## Tools & Transformers Used

- FME Form (Advanced Workbench features)
- Parameters: Published, Private, User Parameters
- Core Transformers: `SchemaMapper`, `Logger`, `Tester`, `GenericReader`, `GenericWriter`, `CustomTransformer`, `AttributeExploder`, `SchemaScanner`
- Formats: CSV, GeoPackage, SHP, JSON, Excel, ZIP, WFS

---

## Repository Navigation

Each module/project includes:
- A dedicated folder
- `.fmw` workspace
- `README.md` with goals, tools, transformers used, and screenshots

---

## Status

**In Progress** – July & August 2025  
I am actively converting each course module into a documented, recruiter-ready project as part of my FME Data Automation portfolio.
