# ðŸ”„ Read from and Write to Multiple Locations (Fanouts) â€“ FME Form Advanced

## ðŸ§­ Project Overview  
This mini-project demonstrates how to use **fanouts** in FME to dynamically write features into multiple outputs based on attribute values. Fanouts help automate the separation of datasets by category, location, or feature typeâ€”without manually creating separate writers. This is essential for scalable, multi-target data distribution.

---

## ðŸ§° Core Tools Used  
- **Generic Reader (FileGDB)** â€“ Reads a complex File Geodatabase dataset  
- **Generic Writer (using Fanouts)** â€“ Writes data to multiple output files or datasets based on attribute logic  
- **Published Parameters** â€“ Enable dynamic output folder selection  
- **Fanout by Attribute** â€“ Automatically creates multiple destination files (e.g., one per vendor, zone, or feature type)

## ðŸ“¥ Inputs & ðŸ“¤ Outputs  

| Input Dataset | Output Format |
|---------------|----------------|
| File Geodatabase with various civic assets | Multiple fanout GDBs or folders, separated by `fme_feature_type` or custom attributes |

ðŸ“Œ Example:
- Input: One dataset with all assets (parks, libraries, fountains)
- Output: Separate files or folders for each feature type (e.g., `Libraries.gdb`, `Parks.gdb`, `Fountains.gdb`)

## ðŸ§© Workflow Highlights  

1. **Data Ingestion**: Load a single complex geodatabase containing multiple feature types.
2. **Fanout Logic Setup**: Configure writer fanouts based on `fme_feature_type` or any relevant attribute.
3. **Dynamic Output Control**: Use published parameters to control the base output path or schema.
4. **Write to Multiple Targets**: FME automatically separates and writes each category to its respective destination without requiring duplicate writers.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaway  
This project highlights the power of **dynamic, scalable writing in FME**. Fanouts remove the need for repetitive configuration and allow one workspace to support unlimited feature classes, client zones, or regions. It prepares you for **real-world enterprise workflows where data must be delivered to multiple systems, departments, or files** in a repeatable way.
