This mini project highlights my work on **Day 5** of the [FME Form Basic course](https://academy.safe.com/path/fme-form-basic/debug-workspaces/163870), where I engaged in exercises focused on debugging FME workspaces. The experience enhanced my ability to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues within data transformation workflows.

## ✅ What I Did

I completed a series of exercises that involved:

- Utilizing **breakpoints** to pause and inspect data flow at specific points in the workspace.
- Employing the **Inspector** transformer to visualize and verify data at various stages.
- Analyzing transformer logs and error messages to pinpoint issues.
- Implementing **TestFilter** transformers to validate data against specific conditions.
- Adjusting workspace parameters to troubleshoot and correct data processing errors.

## 🔍 Project Workflow Overview

### 🗂️ Input:
- Sample datasets with intentional errors and inconsistencies to simulate real-world debugging scenarios.

### 🔧 Process:
- Inserted breakpoints to halt execution and examine data attributes.
- Used Inspectors to view intermediate data outputs.
- Interpreted log files to understand error messages and warnings.
- Applied TestFilters to segregate data based on validation rules.
- Modified transformer parameters to correct data processing logic.

### 📤 Output:
- A fully debugged and functional FME workspace capable of handling the provided datasets without errors.
