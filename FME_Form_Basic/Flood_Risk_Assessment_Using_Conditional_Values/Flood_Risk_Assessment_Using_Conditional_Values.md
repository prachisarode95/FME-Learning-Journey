# 🌊 Flood Risk Assessment Using Conditional Values

## 📘 About the exercise

This is a hands-on exercise from the **FME Form Basic course** by Safe Software, under the "Use Conditional Values" path. It demonstrates how to assign flood risk scores to address points by using conditional logic based on elevation and proximity to coastal zones. The entire workflow was built and executed using **FME Workbench 2024.2**, showcasing real-world attribute transformation and spatial analysis techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **FME Workbench**  
  For designing, building, and executing the flood risk assessment workflow.

- **FME Data Inspector**  
  To visually inspect and verify the flood risk values assigned to each address.

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

The data transformation process followed these steps:

1. **Read Input Datasets**:  
   - Postal addresses  
   - Coastal zones  
   - Digital elevation model (DEM)

2. **Identify Addresses Near the Coast**:  
   - Use `PointOnAreaOverlayer` to overlay addresses with coastal zone boundaries.
   - Apply `Tester` to select addresses within specified distances (100m, 200m, 300m).

3. **Extract Elevation Values**:  
   - Use `Reprojector` to match the DEM and address projections.
   - Apply `PointOnRasterValueExtractor` to extract elevation values from the DEM.

4. **Clean Attribute Names**:  
   - Use `AttributeRenamer` to tidy up and standardize attribute names.

5. **Assign Flood Risk Score**:  
   - Use `AttributeManager` with conditional values to assign a risk score based on elevation and proximity.

6. **Write Final Output**:  
   - Export the enriched dataset with flood risk scores assigned to each address.
