# FME Form Basic - Training & Project Showcase 🚀

This folder documents my hands-on learning journey through the [FME Form Basic Training Path](https://academy.safe.com/path/fme-form-basic) offered by Safe Software. The course consists of 12 beginner-friendly modules focused on building foundational ETL workflows using FME Form (formerly FME Workbench).

🎯 **Goal**  
To gain practical experience in spatial ETL by implementing key exercises as mini-projects that reflect real-world GIS data transformation tasks.

📚 **Course Overview**  
The official FME Form Basic course introduces key concepts such as reading/writing spatial data, transformation logic, conditional values, debugging, and workspace design.

## ✅ Modules Covered with Project Work

Below are the modules from the course I used to build individual mini-projects. Each project folder contains a detailed `README.md` that outlines the objective, tools used, and the workflow snapshot.

| Module | Mini Project | Folder Name |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Transforming Data | City-wise Transformation Automation | `Transforming_Data` |
| Advanced Reading & Writing | Dynamic Data Extraction & Output | `Advanced_Reading_Writing` |
| Debugging Workspaces | Error Handling & QA in ETL | `Debugging_Workspaces` |
| Using Conditional Values | Flood Risk Assessment Logic | `Flood_Risk_Assessment_Using_Conditional_Values` |

> 💡 These projects were built by customizing the training exercises to simulate real-world GIS scenarios. The workflows demonstrate practical use of core transformers, schema mapping, conditional logic, and error tracking.
